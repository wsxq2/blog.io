## 简介
> Spleeter is the Deezer source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses Tensorflow. It makes it easy to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides already trained state of the art model for performing various flavour of separation :
> 
> Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation (2 stems)
> Vocals / drums / bass / other separation (4 stems)
> Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation (5 stems)
> 2 stems and 4 stems models have state of the art performances on the musdb dataset. Spleeter is also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.
> 
> We designed Spleeter so you can use it straight from command line as well as directly in your own development pipeline as a Python library. It can be installed with Conda, with pip or be used with Docker.

## 使用
分离两个音轨：
```
spleeter separate -i audio_example.mp3 -o audio_output -p spleeter:2stems
```
